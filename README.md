# Web3 Derivatives Trading Platform

## Overview
This project is a **Web3 platform for futures and options trading** with cryptocurrencies as the underlying assets. Built with **Next.js**, the platform leverages **smart contracts** for secure and automated transactions and uses the **Black-Scholes algorithm** to calculate premium rates for options.

## Features
- **Cryptocurrency Derivatives**: Trade futures and options with crypto as underlying assets.
- **Smart Contracts**: Fully automated, trustless transactions with reduced counterparty risk.
- **Black-Scholes Algorithm**: Accurate and real-time calculation of option premiums.
- **Non-Custodial**: Users retain complete control of their funds.
- **Global Accessibility**: Seamless access without intermediaries.

## Advantages
- Near-instant settlement of trades.
- Transparent and immutable audit trail.
- Integration with decentralized oracles for real-time market data.
- Programmable and customizable derivatives.
- Cost-efficient operations without intermediaries.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for server-side rendering and a seamless user experience.
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity and deployed on Ethereum (or another EVM-compatible blockchain).
- **Blockchain Oracles**: Integration with services like [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) for market data.
- **State Management**: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for rapid UI development.

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Install Node.js (>=16.x) from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Metamask Wallet**: Browser extension for interacting with blockchain.
3. **Ethereum Network**: Testnet like Goerli or a local blockchain using tools like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).
4. **Environment Variables**: Set up `.env` file for sensitive configurations.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web3-derivatives-platform.git
cd web3-derivatives-platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<API endpoint>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=<Blockchain Network ID>
PRIVATE_KEY=<Private key for contract deployment>
INFURA_API_KEY=<Infura API key>
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Access the platform at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Deploy Smart Contracts
Use Hardhat or Truffle to deploy smart contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat deploy --network <network>
```
